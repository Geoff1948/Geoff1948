- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Geoff1948. I'm retired but have always been interested in electronics.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Espressif Firebeetle ESP32. I've been deleloping a system for monitoring and controlling two watering systems in my garden, as I'm a keen gardener. Six Firebeetles sample percentage soil moisture and report to Thingspeak every three hours at two minute intervals, while the other interprets the data and controls the valves. A separate Thingspeak channel registers battery levels. I struggled with the Firebeetle deep sleep mode and was on the verge of using Espressif's own language but after more than two years I have almost completed my project using Arduino and hope to publicise it on GitHub soon. I plan to call the project Raingods and Watergods after the nicknames for the sensors and controller.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...for first contact, write on my message board. Later maybe email.
