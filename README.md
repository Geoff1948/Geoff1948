- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Geoff1948. I'm retired but have always been interested in electronics.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Espressif ESP32. I've been deleloping a system for monitoring and controlling two watering systems in my garden, as I'm a keen gardener. One ESP32 is intended to sample percentage soil moisture and reporting to Thingspeak every three hours on the hour, while the other interprets the data and controls the valves. Am struggling to get Deep Sleep to work without stack errors, and conclude that Arduino IDE is somehow influencing the size of ULP Clock memory available. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Espressif IDF.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...for first contact, write on my message board. Later maybe email.
